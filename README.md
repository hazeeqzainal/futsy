# Futsy - Futsal Booking App

### **Problem:**  
We have been taking attendance of futsal sessions thru a Whatsapp group. Chain of message for attendance sometimes causes discrepancies for people putting in their names and confirmation of payments.

### **Solution:**  
This could be solved by using an excel sheet to compile or google forms to submit attendance for booking. However, I will take this opportunity to create a webapp for me to study new technologies. It will be a simple webapp where users can login with their social accounts to submit attendance, submit confirmation or proof of payment, browse the upcoming sessions, along with other features.

### **Features:**
1. Login
2. Landing Page - Upcoming Futsal Session
	- Teams
	- Attendees
3. My Futsal Sessions Page - Futsal Confirmations
	- Show Futsal Pitch confirmations
	- Add to calendar iOS/Android
4. Create futsal session (Admin)

### **MVP User stories:**
1. As an admin, I want to be able to create a futsal session for users to enter their names.
2. As a user, I want to login to browse upcoming sessions.
3. As a user, I want to put my name in a team for upcoming sessions.
4. As a super admin, I want to see all futsal sessions created by all admins.

### **Tech Stack:**
1. React
2. Auth0
3. Firebase

### **Other Notes:**  
I will avoid as much libraries/helpers as possible in order to build a strong foundation with this stack.
